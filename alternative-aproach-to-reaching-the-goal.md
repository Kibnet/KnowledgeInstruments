## Creatique of design by consumer

Most of users can think only within a boundaries of tools that they are used too.
Same thing is about interfaces.
There is no point in focusing now on the platform: windows/linux or else.
Rather we should focuse on maximal flexibility.

## Need to create overview of existing tools operating with knowledge and logic

TauChain https://www.idni.org/
Lean https://leanprover-community.github.io/


## Project goals

Im not clear if this project is about developign new software tool or a about addopting some of existing instruments.

## Community work

Depending of the purpouse of the project, particular actions have to be made in order to make it accessible by others.
If project is about development, the it would be wise to make it as publicly available as possible.
So it will invite contributors and possible users around the gloab.

## Need for deffintions

We have to agree on various deffinitions. Like: `ложная информация`(false information).
What is false information or what IS information?

## Need to poot aside information representation and relations within information

One of the key failuyres of modern software related to information processing is mixing of onformation organization and formatting.
Simple example is `latex` where you have mix of code ralated to formating and the code related to onformation descriptin(formulas).
